\section*{Introduction}
\section*{Thanks}
Thanks to my friends and coworkers who've shared recipes they love with me in the hopes of getting them converted. Without your recipes, this book never could have been done.

\noindent Special thanks to those who have helped me pull off these conversions by testing my recipes.

\noindent Finally, thank you to friends, family, and God for providing me with the emotional support to pull this endeavor off.
